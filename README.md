# lasswitz - Open Access Academic Editing Platform

Lasswitz, or LaÃŸwitz, is an authoring tool for academic and scientific writings which looks to improve scientific and intellectual work through peer-to-peer exchanges. At the same time, it provides an open path for ANY person to interact, to suggest or to raise questions about the contents of each work.
